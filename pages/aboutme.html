<p>
    My name is Adriana. Nice to meet you!
</p>

<p>
    I grew up in a mid-sized city named Duisburg. 
    My parents are originally Italian, so I got raised multi-lingual. Even though at times I felt neither really Italian nor German, I now fully embrace this "identity conflict". My biggest passions are around the fields of technology, natural science and weightlifting. Social justice is an important topic for me.
</p>

<p>
    From early on I was fascinated with science. At school my favorite subjects were biology, chemistry and mathematics. Towards the end of my school journey I also have extra lessons to younger children in various subjects. I love teaching and learning new things myself!
